# HBnB Technical Documentation

## Introduction
This document serves as a comprehensive blueprint for the HBnB project. It includes various diagrams and explanatory notes that guide the implementation phases, providing a clear reference for the systemâ€™s architecture and design.

## High-Level Architecture
### High-Level Package Diagram
![High-Level Package Diagram](path/to/your/package_diagram.png) 

**Description**: This diagram illustrates the three-layer architecture of the HBnB application, showing the Presentation Layer, Business Logic Layer, and Persistence Layer, along with their interactions via the facade pattern.

**Key Components**:
- **Presentation Layer**: Services and APIs.
- **Business Logic Layer**: Core models (User, Place, Review, Amenity).
- **Persistence Layer**: Database access.

**Design Decisions**: The facade pattern simplifies the interaction between layers by providing a unified interface.

## Business Logic Layer
### Detailed Class Diagram

**Description**: This diagram represents the internal structure of the Business Logic layer, including entities, attributes, methods, and relationships.

**Key Entities**:
- **User**: Attributes (username, email), Methods (register, login).
- **Place**: Attributes (location, description), Methods (create, update).
- **Review**: Attributes (rating, comment), Methods (submit, edit).
- **Amenity**: Attributes (type, availability), Methods (add, remove).

**Relationships**: Illustrates associations and dependencies between entities.

## API Interaction Flow
### Sequence Diagrams
